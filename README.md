# Page Rank Demo
This project is a basic demonstration of how the Page Rank is found mathematically using eigen vectors. Feel free to tinker with the code and test different possibilitites.
The demostration video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUKsqBxP4-k

## Limitations (for now):
- All webpages should be interconnected
- The page rank vector is computed via rref method so it's a little inefficient and can cause system to lag if a huge number pages exist

## Installation
``npm install .``

## Deploy
``npm run dev``

## Todo (in future)
- [ ] Change the eigen value calculation algorithm
- [ ] Take care for dead end condition
- [ ] Beautifying the Homepage
